# Human-Activity-Recognition
STEPS TO BUILD THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

Step 1:
Importing NumPy and Pandas. Setting up the directory to the folder name in which the data is stored.

Step 2:
Importing SciKitLearn and Keras using Tensorflow Backend.

Step 3:
Setting up the attributes using an array. Importing and reading the data from Phone Accelometer.

Step 4:
Importing and reading the data from Phone Gyroscope, Watch gyroscope and Watch accelometer respectively. 

Step 5:
o	Replacing “;” by “ “  in the 6th column. 
o	Setting the type of ‘x’ , ‘y’, ‘z’ to float integers
o	Obtaining the info of the dataset so formed.

Step 6:
Combining the data from Phone Gyroscope and Phone Accelometer.

Step 7:
Combining the data from watch gyroscope and watch accelometer.

Step 8:
Combining the data of phone and watch both.

Step 9:
Defining all the activity of the dataset with a function.

Step 10:
o	Data Preprocessing
o	Using LabelEncoder doing feature scaling

Step 11:
Forming a frame using scipy.stats

Step 12:
Splitting Training and Test set and determining the shape of Training set and Test set

Step 13:
Reshaping the Training and test set using reshape function.

Step 14:
Applying a convolutional 2D network. With activation fuction as Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)

Step 15:
Compiling the model using model.fit method with 8 epochs.

Result: Achieved an accuracy of 71% in 8 Epochs.
